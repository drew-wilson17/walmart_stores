## Number of Walmart Stores by State: An Interactive Web Map

### Introduction
This webmap is an interactive custom-made webmap that explores how many Walmart stores are in each state. Founded from humble beginning in Arkansas, Walmart has grown to become the largest US company by revenue and employees. It has over 5,200 stores in the United States and topped $635 billion in sales last year (National Retail Federation). While the retailer has a giant footprint across the country, there are still a few states that remain adverse to the retail giant - many New England and northern Plains states have fought against Walmart's entry into their states, showing an interesting pattern across the country.
